This monorepo contains a shared React package (`@repo/app`) that adapts to different environments, powering both a Vite-based web app and an Electron-Vite desktop app. It uses Turborepo for efficient management and development across packages, with UI components powered by shadcn/ui and code formatting handled by Prettier.

## What's Inside?

### Apps

- `web`: Vite-powered React web application
- `desktop`: Electron-Vite desktop application
- `backend`: Bun-based backend service with Hono and tRPC

### Packages

- `@repo/app`: Shared React `<App />` component
- `@repo/ui`: Shared UI components (powered by shadcn/ui)
- `@repo/shared`: Reusable components, hooks, and API integrations
- `@repo/typescript-config`: Base TypeScript configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.17.0 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9.12.0 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JakubGluszek/web-desktop-app.git
   cd web-desktop-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ./scripts/generate-env.sh
   pnpm generate-env
   ```

### Development

Run all apps:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Run specific apps:

```sh
pnpm dev --filter web
pnpm --filter desktop desktop:dev
pnpm dev --filter backend
```

### Building

Build all apps:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Build desktop app:

```sh
pnpm --filter desktop build:linux
pnpm --filter desktop build:win
pnpm --filter desktop build:mac
```

## Electron-builder Workflow

This project uses Electron-builder to package and distribute the desktop application. The configuration for Electron-builder can be found in the `electron-builder.yml` file. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Build Configuration**: The `electron-builder.yml` file defines build settings for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
2. **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions are used to automate the build process for different platforms.
3. **Auto-updates**: The project is set up to support auto-updates, but this feature is not yet implemented. The update server URL in the `electron-builder.yml` file will need to be configured once the Astro site and proxy server are set up.

## Repository Secrets

To ensure secure builds and deployments, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The URL of your deployed API server 
2. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key for S3 bucket access
3. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key for S3 bucket access
4. `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket for storing builds
5. `AWS_REGION`: The region of your S3 bucket, e.g `eu-north-1`

To add these secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Click on "New repository secret" and add each secret

## S3 Bucket Usage

This project uses Amazon S3 buckets for storing application builds. Here's how it's currently utilized:

1. **Build Storage**: Compiled application builds are uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.
2. **Future Update Distribution**: Once implemented, the auto-update feature will fetch updates via the proxy server, which will retrieve files from the S3 bucket.

Ensure that your S3 bucket is properly configured with the correct permissions and public access settings for seamless distribution.

## Adding UI Components

To add new shadcn/ui components to your project, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm ui add <component-name>
```

This command works similarly to the shadcn/ui CLI, allowing you to easily integrate new components into your project.

## Code Formatting

This project uses Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting. To format your code, run:

```sh
pnpm format
```

To check if your code is properly formatted without making changes, use:

```sh
pnpm format:check
```
